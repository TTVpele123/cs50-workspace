# CS50 Workspace!

Use this repository to work on your CS50 projects!

1. First, download and install these three programs:
    * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - This is the code editor!
    * [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) - The python "interpreter" that lets us run python programs
    * [git](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/) - git is the program that saves and your work, it's a lot like google drive but for programmers
2. Open my [VSCode Profile link](https://vscode.dev/editor/profile/github/f243a61bd1b32fec27547e1ab25e24cb) and click the blue "Create in Visual Studio Code" button on the bottom right. This will import the profile I made for you, which will help install and configure a number of things.
3. Clone this repository on Github using the green button in the upper right. When finished, copy the link to it.
4. Open VSCode, click the files icon at the top of the left sidebar, then click the blue "Clone Repository" button
5. Paste in the link you copied earlier (the link to your Github repository) and hit go.
6. Use the menu at the top to open terminal by clicking Terminal >> New Terminal
7. Test if you can run your code! Use `cd python-test` to move into the python-test folder then `python hello-world.py` (or `python3 hello-world.py`) to run the python file.

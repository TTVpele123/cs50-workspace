# CS50 Workspace!

Use this repository to work on your CS50 projects!

1. First, download and install these four programs:
    * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - This is the code editor!
    * [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) - The python "interpreter" that lets us run python programs.
    * [git](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/) - git is the program that saves and your work, it's a lot like google drive but for programmers. If you get an "unknown developer" warning when you try to open the installer package, try going to Finder, right clicking the installer package, then clicking Open from that menu. This should give you the option to open and complete the install.
    * [Github CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/v2.62.0/gh_2.62.0_macOS_universal.pkg) - Github  CLI is what lets you save, submit, and check your code using the command line, you need it to use submit50 and check50. You might also get an "unknown developer" warning here, follow the same steps as above.
2. Download the CS50 VSCode Profile [with this link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=19O9L1eGiU19j441sVVzeuvSFwhzLx5Po) - this will install and setup all of the important extensions and settings for you after we import it.
3. Open VSCode, then click the Gear icon in the bottom left. Click "Profiles" >> "Import Profile" >> "Select File" and choose the file you just downloaded, which is named `cs50.code-profile`.
4. Clone this repository on Github using the green "Use as Template" button in the upper right. When finished, copy the link to it.
5. Open VSCode, click the files icon at the top of the left sidebar, then click the blue "Clone Repository" button
6. Paste in the link you copied earlier (the link to your Github repository) and hit go.
7. Use the menu at the top to open terminal by clicking Terminal >> New Terminal
8. Test if you can run your code!
    * Use `cd python-test` to move into the python-test folder
    * Then `python hello-world.py` (or `python3 hello-world.py`) to run the python file

## Testing and Submitting
